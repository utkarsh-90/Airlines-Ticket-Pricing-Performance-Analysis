# Airlines Ticket Pricing & Performance Analysis

Welcome!  
This project is a hands-on exploration into how airlines price their tickets and how various factors impact both pricing and performance.

---

## 🚀 What is this project about?

Airline ticket pricing can sometimes feel like magic or chaos (or both). In this project, I wanted to dig into the data and find out:
- What factors influence airline ticket prices?
- Can we spot any patterns or trends?
- How do different airlines compare when it comes to pricing, performance, and delays?

---

## 💾 Dataset

- **File:** `Dataset.csv`
- **Source:** Provided as part of project coursework
- The dataset includes features like airline name, flight duration, number of stops, ticket price, and more.

---

## 🔍 What did I try to solve?

- Understand what drives the price of airline tickets
- Analyze trends based on airlines, stops, durations, and more
- Explore which airlines perform better on key metrics (like punctuality or price)

---

## 📈 What did I do?

- Cleaned and explored the dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)
- Created visualizations to spot trends and patterns
- Compared different airlines and identified interesting insights

You can check the main analysis in the Jupyter notebook:  
`notebooks/Airlines Ticket Pricing & Performance Analysis.ipynb`
